# Em - Math

This is a fun little project I started in about an hour one night after working with my foster son who really struggles with math. I wanted to create a fun gamified way to practice and "pass off" different times tables.

# Roadmap

Where to take this project in the future:

## Division

Add in support for division as well. Will mostly take the same structure as multiplication, but will need to be adjusted.

## General Game

### Linear vs Shuffle

Implement linear mode. Which will score you fewer points. But you also have a little less time. 

### Progress

I'm too lazy and it costs to much (aka anything above $0) to host a server and a db to do it the right way. So just save and restore progress from localStorage.

### Pass Offs

Show the user which levels they have passed off. Maybe little colored squares inside the buttons, one for each.

### High Scores

Implementing a more robust scoring system. So not just how many they got right on submission, but also include how fast they finished all of the problems, what the difficulty was, time between answers, etc.

### Insanity Mode

A new even more crazy difficulty that has less time and more numbers.

## Other Thoughts

Probably want to add other games for addition, and subtraction.

Fractions and decimals.

Up the number of animations, and fun. This is a game for kids.

Full Random Mode. Can be any number by any number.

Next table button. Quick and easy way to just go to the next times table.
